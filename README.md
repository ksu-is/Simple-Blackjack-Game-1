# Blackjack GUI
This python project will modify the simple blackjack game. The end goal is to add a GUI and multiplayer mode.

MAJOR UPDATE: This will be based of an existing blackjack game in pygame. I have modified it to have a title sceen, as well as changing the screen size to better accomadate the future multiplayer mode. There were also some bug fixes, that being 2 syntax errors and changes in the file paths for card images.
